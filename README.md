A deep convolutional neural network model built with TensorFlow to recognize number signs made by a hand from 0 to 5 in sign language with a pretty impressive accuracy (80%), as well as execute them in a computation graph.

## To Run
- Add your own number sign image in the images folder
- Open the Convolution_model_Application_v1a.ipynb file in jupyter notebook
- Enter the name of the image that u put in images folder within the quotes
- Click on Kernel -> Restart and Run All Cells
